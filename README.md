## Lidar_Raspberry_Project

# Introduction

It is part of my personal project for the end-of-studies year in SETSIS program, EUPI Clermont Ferrand.
This is the official link of the program : http://setsis.eupi.uca.fr/?page_id=7

# Purpose 

The objecctif of this project is to make a system that detect the presence in specific pre-defined surfaces,

I will use the LIDAR to collect certain key points in the plane surface that will form specific areas.
The next step is to plot the LIDAR results in the camera rendering it will provide a good view of the solution.

# Presentation video 

In part of this project, I made a small video where I introduce myself, my domain and brief introduction of this project.
